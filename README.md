# Passsword Generator

In this project we were asked to generate a random password based on criteria provided by the user. This included the length of the password and whether to include upper-case, lower-case, numeric and/or special characters. A password with the requested paramaters will print to the box on the site. 

The generator will verify if a valid password length is entered and ensure that at least one set of characters are selected to generate the password. Any invalid entries alert the user, ask them to try again and terminate the program.

* The generator will start when the user clicks the button on screen

* Followed by a series of confirmations about what characters they wish to be using

    ![There are a total of 4 confirmation boxs following the initial input from the user](./assets/screenshots/shot2.png)

* Errors will end the program and require the user to start over
